I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine at the [People's hospital](https://www.pkuph.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Cuiling Feng]. My research interests include AI for ECG (AI-ECG), medical time-series data, and digital health tools.

You can find my CV here: [Long Zhou's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
